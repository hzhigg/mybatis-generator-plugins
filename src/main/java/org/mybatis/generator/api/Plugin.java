/**
 * 这个接口定义了在不同时间被调用的方法
 * 代码生成过程。 这些方法可以用来扩展或修改
 * 生成的代码。 客户可以完整地实现这个接口，或者
 * 扩展PluginAdapter（强烈推荐）。
 * <p>
 * 插件有一个生命周期。 一般来说，生命周期是这样的：
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>setXXX方法被调用一次</li>
 * <li>validate方法调用，该方法一般用于验证传给参数的正确性，如果该方法返回false，则该插件结束执行；</li>
 * <li>initialized方法被调用，用于初始化操作，传入IntrospectedTable</li>
 * <li>为每个introspected table调用clientXXX方法</li>
 * <li>为每个introspected table调用providerXXX方法</li>
 * <li>为每个introspected table调用modelXXX方法</li>
 * <li>为每个introspected table调用sqlMapXXX方法</li>
 * <li>contextGenerateAdditionalJavaFiles(IntrospectedTable)方法调用(生成额外的Java文件，MBG自己是没有实现这个方法的，提供给插件一个扩展机会)</li>
 * <li>contextGenerateAdditionalXmlFiles(IntrospectedTable)方法调用(同理，生成额外的XML文件，MBG自己是没有实现这个方法的，提供给插件一个扩展机会)</li>
 * <li>contextGenerateAdditionalJavaFiles()方法调用，同contextGenerateAdditionalJavaFiles(IntrospectedTable)方法，只是没有参数而已</li>
 * <li>contextGenerateAdditionalXmlFiles()方法调用，同contextGenerateAdditionalXmlFiles(IntrospectedTable)方法，只是没有提供参数</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 *插件与上下文相关 - 所以每个上下文将有自己的一套
 *插件。 如果在多个上下文中指定了相同的插件，则每个插件
 *上下文将保存插件的唯一实例。
 * <p>
 *以指定的顺序调用插件，并初始化配置文件。
 * <p>
 *clientXXX，modelXXX和sqlMapXXX方法由generators调用
 *如果你用其他的替换默认的代码生成器实现
 *这些方法可能不会被调用。
